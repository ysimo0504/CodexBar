# Refresh loop

## Cadence
- `RefreshFrequency`: Manual, 1m, 2m, 5m, 15m, 30m, Adaptive (fresh-install default), and
  Adaptive (agent-aware).
- Stored in `UserDefaults` via `SettingsStore`. An unset cadence resolves to Adaptive only when no prior-launch marker
  or existing config is present, and the resolved value is persisted immediately. Existing installations without a
  stored cadence and unrecognized stored values resolve to the legacy 5-minute fallback. Every valid stored choice,
  including Manual and each fixed interval, remains unchanged.

## Behavior
- Background refresh runs off-main and updates `UsageStore` (usage + credits + optional web scrape).
- Manual “Refresh now” always available in the menu.
- Stale/error states dim the icon and surface status in-menu.
- Optional provider-storage scans run only when “Show provider storage usage” is enabled. They are scheduled in the
  background, coalesced/throttled during automatic refreshes, and forced by manual refresh without blocking the usage
  refresh path.
- Transient Codex OAuth transport failures preserve prior usage and widget entries for the same account, including
  their original update time. Classification uses the underlying transport code, so localized error messages behave
  consistently. Startup connectivity retries and refresh-failure hook statuses use the same transport identity;
  cancellation does not schedule a retry. Authentication failures and account changes still invalidate prior usage.
- Explicit Claude OAuth, Cursor app/stored sessions, Vertex AI, and Ollama API requests also retain transport identity
  through provider-specific diagnostics. Recognized temporary network failures keep the last successful snapshot and
  its original measurement time, and use the existing startup-retry and refresh-hook categories even with localized
  messages. Vertex AI and Ollama API snapshots contain identity rather than quota windows. Authentication, source
  selection, and stale-refresh invalidation retain their existing rules. Wrapped Codex and Vertex AI cancellations
  are suppressed before the consecutive-failure gate, including localized transport errors.

## Adaptive mode
- `AdaptiveRefreshPolicy` (`Sources/CodexBar/AdaptiveRefreshPolicy.swift`) is a pure function of an `Input`
  (current time, last menu-open time, latest local coding-activity time, Low Power Mode, thermal state) that returns
  the next delay and a stable `Reason`. It reads no clock and no `ProcessInfo` state itself;
  `UsageStore.startTimer()` gathers those impure signals immediately before each tick.
- Policy table, first match wins:

  | Condition | Delay | Reason |
  |---|---:|---|
  | Low Power Mode enabled, or thermal state `.serious`/`.critical` | 30 min | `constrained` |
  | Menu opened at most 5 min ago (including future/clock-adjusted timestamps) | 2 min | `recentInteraction` |
  | Menu opened more than 5 min and at most 1 h ago | 5 min | `warm` |
  | Local Codex or Claude transcript activity observed less than 5 min ago, when the menu rule would be slower | 5 min | `codingActivity` |
  | Menu opened 1–4 h ago | 15 min | `idle` |
  | No recorded menu open, or opened 4+ h ago | 30 min | `longIdle` |

- Every decision falls in the 2–30 min range by construction. Deliberately excludes quota, latency, error,
  account, and time-of-day signals.
- `UsageStore` tracks `lastMenuOpenAt` and `lastCodingActivityAt` in memory only (never persisted; both reset on
  launch). A menu open can bring either adaptive mode forward. A newer local activity observation can affect only
  Adaptive (agent-aware); it never affects plain Adaptive, postpones an earlier tick, or refreshes synchronously.
- Adaptive (agent-aware) reuses `LocalAgentSessionScanner` every 30 seconds only after the user allows local coding
  activity. The
  persisted `adaptiveActivityScanConsent` value is `undecided`, `allowed`, or `declined`; missing or invalid values are
  repaired to `undecided`, which never authorizes a scan. Declining selects plain Adaptive; explicitly selecting the
  agent-aware option again asks again.
- An allowed scan runs `ps -axo ... command=` to inspect the running-process list and identify Codex/Claude, then runs
  `lsof` when needed and enumerates known session metadata only when an agent process is detected. It then reads
  recent Codex rollouts, reads rollout first-line metadata and mtimes, and inspects Claude transcript metadata. When
  the Agent Sessions UI is off, CodexBar discards the resulting session records and retains only the latest `Date`.
  Each scan considers at most 64 agent processes, parses at most 128 Codex rollout metadata records, keeps at most 64
  Claude transcript candidates per project, and shares a 512-entry, depth-1, 150 ms agent-aware directory metadata
  budget. Future
  transcript mtimes are clamped to one scanner-lifetime timestamp. The clamp retains no file paths, and unchanged
  future-dated files cannot manufacture newer activity every 30 seconds.
  Agent-aware scans pause under Low Power Mode and serious/critical thermal pressure. Explicitly enabling Agent
  Sessions continues to authorize its local scan independently of the Adaptive consent choice. Tailscale discovery and
  SSH remain behind the Agent Sessions setting. The activity timestamp is not persisted, logged, or uploaded, and it is
  cleared when consent is revoked.
- Each adaptive tick recomputes the delay after the previous refresh completes, sleeps, then calls the same
  `UsageStore.refresh()` used by fixed-interval mode, so the existing `isRefreshing` coalescing guard still
  applies — only one provider-batch refresh runs at a time regardless of cadence mode.
- Selected delay and reason are logged (e.g. `reason=warm delay=300s` in the `adaptive-refresh` category) through
  the existing local logger; never provider identity, account, email, workspace, path, credentials, or response data.
- Interval-derived heuristics (reset-boundary refresh, OpenAI web staleness, persistent-CLI-session idle windows)
  read `UsageStore.normalRefreshIntervalForHeuristics()`, which resolves adaptive mode to the current decision's
  delay — they stay active in adaptive mode rather than degrading to manual, whose interval is nil.

## Optional future
- Auto-seed a log if none exists via `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check --json "ping"` (currently not executed).
