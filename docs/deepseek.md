# DeepSeek provider

CodexBar can use either a DeepSeek API key or a signed-in DeepSeek Platform session for the remaining credit balance.
Detailed cost and token usage comes from the Platform session; an API key cannot authenticate the private dashboard
endpoints.

## Data sources

1. **Optional API key** supplied via `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `DEEPSEEK_KEY`, or selected from DeepSeek token accounts in `~/.codexbar/config.json`.
2. **API-key balance endpoint**
   - `GET https://api.deepseek.com/user/balance`
   - Request headers: `Authorization: Bearer <api key>`, `Accept: application/json`
   - Response contains `is_available`, and a `balance_infos` array with per-currency entries
     (`total_balance`, `granted_balance`, `topped_up_balance`).
3. **Platform-session balance endpoint**
   - `GET https://platform.deepseek.com/api/v0/users/get_user_summary`
   - Request headers: `Authorization: Bearer <platform userToken>`, `Accept: application/json`
   - Used as the balance source when no API key is configured.
4. **Optional detailed usage endpoints**
   - Preferred: `GET https://platform.deepseek.com/api/v0/usage/by_api_key/amount?start=<unix>&end=<unix>&tz=<offset>`
     and `.../by_api_key/cost?...` — the same per-key daily buckets the Platform usage page loads.
   - Fallback: `GET https://platform.deepseek.com/api/v0/usage/amount?month=<month>&year=<year>`
     and `.../usage/cost?...` if the per-key endpoints fail.
   - Daily buckets use Gregorian dates at the current fixed UTC offset in seconds, matching the API across daylight-saving transitions. Monthly fallback keeps
     Gregorian UTC month selection and date parsing, and is labeled **This month**, not **Last 30 days**.
   - Cancellation stops enrichment without starting monthly fallback requests.
   - Request headers: `Authorization: Bearer <platform userToken>`, `Accept: application/json`, `x-client-platform: web`
   - These are private dashboard endpoints rather than documented public API endpoints and may change without notice.

## Platform session

CodexBar resolves the Platform `userToken` in this order:

1. An explicitly supplied `DEEPSEEK_PLATFORM_TOKEN` / `DEEPSEEK_USER_TOKEN` or a legacy
   `providers[].cookieHeader` value preserved from an existing config.
2. A prompt-free read of `userToken` from the `https://platform.deepseek.com` local-storage origin in Chrome.

The legacy config value remains a compatibility fallback so upgrading cannot silently erase a working browser-only
session. An unscoped legacy or environment token is never combined with an API-key balance; API enrichment requires
a session saved for that credential scope. New automatic imports are never written back to config.

CodexBar checks every Chrome profile containing a parseable `userToken` against DeepSeek. Rejected or expired
sessions are omitted. Settings shows a **Chrome profile** picker containing only valid sessions. With no API key, one
valid session is selected automatically; with multiple valid sessions, CodexBar reuses the saved choice or asks once.
When an API key supplies the balance, a new or changed API credential requires an explicit session selection before
website usage is combined with it. CodexBar persists a stable browser/profile identifier, not an absolute home-directory path, and
keeps automatically imported tokens in memory only. The choice is scoped to a non-reversible fingerprint of the
active API credential and saved-account slot, so replacing a key or switching accounts cannot silently reuse an old
browser session. Validation results are cached briefly so normal
refreshes do not probe every profile, and a temporary network failure does not erase a previously validated profile.
If the selected session expires, CodexBar asks before switching to another valid profile.

Chrome-only balance refreshes also keep the last live balance and its original timestamp through temporary transport
failures when the failed request belongs to the same browser profile and token. This ownership proof stays in memory;
decoded snapshots, changed profiles or tokens, and API-key balances with optional browser enrichment cannot supply it.
Once DeepSeek rejects a session, a later network failure cannot preserve its old balance; successful validation must
restore that session first. A saved profile with unknown validity still supplies transport diagnostics when other profiles
succeed; a known-rejected selection keeps the profile picker and its valid alternatives.
Recognized transport failures still participate in startup retries when no matching balance can be retained. A Chrome-resolution
deadline without an observed session fails closed; cancelled or superseded refresh tasks keep their existing behavior.

If no session is valid, the menu keeps the API-key balance when one exists; otherwise it asks the user to sign in to
DeepSeek Platform in Chrome. Authentication failures returned as top-level or nested DeepSeek codes `40002` and
`40003` are treated as expired sessions.

## Usage details

- The menu card shows total balance with the paid vs. granted breakdown:
  e.g. `$50.00 (Paid: $40.00 / Granted: $10.00)`.
- The API separates granted balance from topped-up balance; CodexBar labels these as granted vs. paid credit.
- With optional extra usage enabled, the menu shows today's and last-30-days cost and tokens,
  request counts, API-key count, the top model, per-model spend, a daily token chart, and a daily spend chart.
- Per-model spend uses the same reporting period and currency as detailed usage: **Last 30 days** for the preferred
  endpoints, or **This month** for monthly fallback. These are Platform-account totals across API keys. Missing or
  invalid model costs are omitted; a reported zero is retained.
- The amount and cost requests run concurrently. After balance arrives, CodexBar waits up to five seconds for
  automatic Chrome resolution and detailed usage. The deadline remains bounded even if a local Chrome read does not
  respond to cancellation. If the optional work fails or times out, the balance and previously validated profile list
  remain available while the menu reports that detailed usage is unavailable.
- With multiple configured API keys, browser-derived detailed usage is shown only with the active API-key account;
  other account cards remain balance-only so website usage is never duplicated across accounts.
- When multiple currencies are present, USD is shown preferentially.
- If total balance is zero, CodexBar shows an add-credits message. If balance is nonzero but `is_available` is false, it shows "Balance unavailable for API calls".
- There is no session or weekly window — DeepSeek does not expose per-window quota via API.
- Token-account selection injects the selected key into the fetch environment; otherwise CodexBar reads `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `DEEPSEEK_KEY`.
