# Architecture overview

## Modules
- `Sources/CodexBarCore`: fetch + parse (Codex RPC, PTY runner, Claude probes, OpenAI web scraping, status polling).
- `Sources/CodexBar`: state + UI (UsageStore, SettingsStore, StatusItemController, menus, icon rendering).
- `Sources/CodexBarWidget`: WidgetKit extension wired to the shared snapshot.
- `Sources/CodexBarCLI`: bundled CLI for `codexbar` usage/status output.
- `Sources/CodexBarClaudeWatchdog`: helper process for stable Claude CLI PTY sessions.
- `Sources/CodexBarClaudeWebProbe`: CLI helper to diagnose Claude web fetches.

## Entry points
- `CodexBarApp`: SwiftUI keepalive + Settings scene.
- `AppDelegate`: wires status controller, Sparkle updater, notifications.

## Data flow
- Background refresh → `UsageFetcher`/provider probes → `UsageStore` → menu/icon/widgets.
- Settings toggles feed `SettingsStore` → `UsageStore` refresh cadence + feature flags.
- Runtime-only provider settings flow through typed, descriptor-registered sections in `ProviderSettingsSnapshot`.

## CLI login lifecycle
- `CodexLoginRunner` and `KiroLoginRunner` resolve their own executable and environment, including Codex home scoping.
- `CLILoginRunner` owns browser-waiting login processes, bounded output capture, timeout/cancellation, and optional
  device-flow progress. It returns one shared result type; provider presentations retain their own recovery messages.
- The login runner and `SubprocessRunner` share `ProcessTermination` and process-tree termination. Cancelling a login
  stops its child process, joins its progress callback task, and produces no failure alert. Timeouts retain captured
  diagnostic output, and inherited pipes cannot keep the caller waiting indefinitely.
- Codex and Grok RPC clients share deadline selection through `RPCRequestTimeout`. The deadline wins before teardown
  can report stdout EOF; each client keeps its protocol initialization, encoding, diagnostics, and error types.

## Concurrency & platform
- Swift 6 strict concurrency enabled; prefer Sendable state and explicit MainActor hops.
- macOS 14+ targeting; avoid deprecated APIs when refactoring.

## Shared policy ownership
- `ProviderCatalog` indexes the immutable generated list of app implementations. JavaScript plugins use their own
  runtime registry. Provider settings contexts bind directly to their store; the shared cookie picker owns mode
  conversion, options, and live subtitle selection while providers retain labels, visibility, and cache scopes. Settings
  link actions resolve their provider-supplied destinations when clicked, including region and account selection.
  Cookie subtitles use explicit localization keys and arguments supplied by providers; the picker selects the current
  mode and Keychain-disabled explanation without parsing English display text.
- Descriptor-registered cookie sections preserve their concrete types after app policy resolves credentials. The app
  keeps its automatic default, Keychain-disabled manual mode, and selected-account normalization; CLI inference stays
  separate. Cookie-source writes share config persistence and logging, with provider-specific side effects retained.
- Core's public descriptor registry keeps one ordered descriptor collection with an index for lookup. Its storage owns
  synchronization, and replacing a descriptor updates metadata and CLI names without changing provider order.
- `UsageStore.presentationSnapshot` owns subscription metadata selection. Live cards use that projection once; explicit
  account cards use only their supplied snapshots, identity, and credits. Compact and stacked Codex account layouts share
  the same account-card builder. Reordering visible providers preserves loaded config records for unavailable plugins;
  config decoding retains its existing known-provider rules.
- `UsageStore.menuCardInput` assembles cards for Settings, the live menu, and explicit account contexts. It owns common
  quota, pace, warning-marker, and display-preference projection. Settings retains diagnostics and all usage lanes;
  menus retain their cost display policy and account-scoped forecasts. An account context stays isolated even when empty.
  Cards consume the reconciled Codex projection; the raw dashboard is not a separate model input.
- App credential properties read directly from the config snapshot and delegate common string writes to the typed
  `SettingsStore` config accessor, which owns normalization, persistence, and secret-update logging. Field activation
  does not trigger credential loading. Legacy provider toggles are read only by the config migrator.
- Token-cost publications own their snapshots, revisions, and source scope in one store. Raw and current-config readers
  select from that same state while retaining confirmed-empty and unpublished distinctions. Provider settings and
  plugin edits reuse Core's config upsert; their defaults and notification policies remain explicit.
- The native status-item controller owns menu composition. Persistent refresh-row metrics are independent of menu
  rendering, and screenshot fixtures exercise the active card views. Legacy menu-layout resolution retains its
  rendering mode and projected layout without copying unused settings into a second state object.
- `SettingsValue` owns whitespace and wrapping-quote normalization for config and provider settings. Readers retain
  their credential precedence, endpoint validation, and provider-specific decoding.
- `ISO8601DateParser` owns fractional-first internet timestamp parsing with a whole-second fallback. Provider readers
  retain their text extraction, whitespace, numeric timestamp, and custom-format policies; each parse owns its formatter.
- Kilo's CLI fetch strategy and organization discovery share `KiloBearerTokenResolver` for auth-file loading.
  Vertex AI credential loading and renewal share display-only ID-token decoding; diagnostic fetch labels use
  `ProviderDiagnosticFetchAttempt` across the app and CLI.
- Core owns status feed fetching, decoding, and status models through `ProviderStatusFetcher`; the app supplies
  localized labels and component UI, and the CLI supplies its existing status payload and English labels.
- `KeychainStringStore` owns generic-password operations for legacy credential migration. Provider adapters retain
  their existing item names, prompt kinds, cookie validation, and cache lifetimes. Structured OAuth/cache stores
  retain their separate persistence and authorization contracts.
- Simple API-token providers use `ProviderFetchPlan.apiToken`; provider loaders retain endpoint-specific behavior
  and optional-data rules. Strategies with credential provenance, region selection, or fallback policies stay explicit.
- `ProviderCostSnapshot.spendLimitWindow` owns spend-budget quota projection. Antigravity's shared family classifier
  owns ID-before-title precedence; visibility and compact widget selection retain their distinct unknown-family rules.
- `TestProcessSafety` owns test-runner recognition; callers retain explicit headless and fixture-path policies.
- `CheckedSum` owns integer overflow handling. Callers still decide whether absent or empty counts mean zero,
  unavailable, or incomplete; persistent accumulators retain their own overflow state.
- `BrowserCookieProfiles` merges browser stores within each profile using the existing expiry and store-priority
  rules. Providers still validate their own sessions. `ExpiringValueCache` supplies their short-lived import caches,
  with a separate cache instance per provider. `CookiePropertyJSON` preserves the legacy Date/URL marker encoding;
  session stores retain their own file envelopes, expiration policies, and secure writes.
- `OpenCodeWebParsing` owns workspace discovery and quota-candidate traversal for OpenCode and OpenCode Go. Each
  supplies its own numeric/window decoder and required-lane policy. Alibaba Token Plan and Qwen Cloud share
  `OneConsoleTokenPlanSnapshot` projection while retaining distinct public snapshot types and provider identities.
- `StreamScanBuffer` supplies bounded overlap for Codex and Claude terminal-marker matching; command handling and
  session lifecycle remain provider-specific.
- Codex's persistent and one-shot PTY readers share `CodexStatusMarkers`, including the marker lengths used for
  bounded overlap. Cursor-query handling remains part of each terminal loop.
- `UsageSnapshot.withAccountLabel` applies token-account fallback labels for the app and CLI while preserving the
  provider's account ID and other identity fields. Codex visible-account labels keep their surface-specific policy.
- Raw Chromium local-storage consumers share `ChromiumLocalStorageDiscovery`, retaining their own browser lists and
  origin decoders. Both plugin engines use the manifest's management-auth eligibility policy after adapting their
  engine-specific option values.
- Codex RPC and OAuth spend limits use `CodexSpendControlNumber` while keeping their wire-field aliases separate.
  Reset values retain truncation toward zero, with unrepresentable values omitted instead of trapping.
- Claude's persistent CLI operations and serialized browser fetches each own an `AsyncOperationGate`; the shared
  implementation retains FIFO ownership and the CLI cleanup path's explicit cancellation exception. CLI usage and
  cards validate account/provider selection through `TokenAccountCLISelection` before resolving credentials.
