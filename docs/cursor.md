# Cursor provider

Cursor can reuse Cursor.app's local session or a cursor.com browser session. On macOS, automatic mode prefers a usable
Cursor.app session and falls back to cookies when the app token is missing, expired, invalid, or rejected. On Linux,
automatic mode uses cached or stored cookies when available, then falls back to the signed-in Cursor app token because
browser import is unavailable.

## Data sources + fallback order

Manual cookie configuration is always the explicit override. The automatic order is Cursor.app → cached cookie → browser
cookie import → stored session on macOS, and cached cookie → stored session → Cursor.app token on Linux. Explicit `web`
mode never reads Cursor.app credentials; macOS uses its cookie ladder, while Linux requires a configured manual cookie.

1) **Cursor.app local auth** (first automatic source on macOS; Linux fallback)
   - Reads Cursor.app's VS Code-style global state DB for `ItemTable` key `cursorAuth/accessToken`.
   - BLOB decoding recognizes BOM-less ASCII UTF-16LE tokens before UTF-8, which would otherwise keep interleaved
     NUL bytes. Other encodings retain the existing UTF-8/UTF-16LE fallback; tokens are not normalized, and malformed
     nonempty values remain distinct from a missing session so they cannot enable stale cached-account fallback.
   - Files consulted by SQLite:
     - macOS main DB: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`
     - Linux main DB: absolute `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.../state.vscdb`, else absolute `$HOME/.config/...`, else account-home `.config/...`
     - Active WAL sidecars when present: `state.vscdb-wal` and `state.vscdb-shm`
   - The database is opened read-only. Active WAL state is read normally; an idle WAL-mode main file with no
     sidecars uses SQLite immutable mode so CodexBar does not recreate files in Cursor's directory.
   - The token is used only while its JWT expiry is more than 60 seconds away. CodexBar never refreshes it.
   - On macOS, a validated derived session is also persisted owner-only at
     `~/Library/Application Support/CodexBar/cursor-session.json` through the standard credential-file writer. Linux
     reads the Cursor database directly and does not persist the app token.
   - When an already-cached cookie exposes a different email or subject, CodexBar logs the mismatch and keeps the
     chosen Cursor.app identity on the usage snapshot/card. It does not combine app usage with browser identity.
   - Temporary transport failures keep the previous usage measurement and its timestamp for an unchanged account,
     including when the network message is localized. The same policy applies to stored sessions; rejected sessions
     still follow the normal sign-in recovery path.

2) **Cached cookie header**
   - Stored after successful browser import.
   - Keychain cache: `com.steipete.codexbar.cache` (account `cookie.cursor`).

3) **Browser cookie import** (macOS only)
   - Cookie order from provider metadata (default: Safari → Chrome → Firefox).
   - Domain filters: `cursor.com`, `cursor.sh`.
   - Cookie names required (any one counts):
     - `WorkosCursorSessionToken`
     - `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`
     - `next-auth.session-token`

4) **Stored session cookies** (legacy fallback on macOS and Linux)
   - Legacy sessions captured by older CodexBar releases remain readable.
   - Stored in the platform Application Support directory: `~/Library/Application Support/CodexBar/cursor-session.json` on
     macOS, or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/CodexBar/cursor-session.json` on Linux (default: `~/.local/share/CodexBar/cursor-session.json`).

On macOS, explicit `--source web` skips Cursor.app local auth and uses only the cookie ladder. On Linux, explicit `web`
requires a configured Manual cookie and never reads the app token. `codexbar usage --provider cursor --source auto --verbose`
prints the selected automatic path and is the quickest live-read check after Cursor login.

Manual option:
- Preferences → Providers → Cursor → Cookie source → Manual.
- Paste the `Cookie:` header from a cursor.com request.

## Add and switch account
- **Add Account** opens `https://authenticator.cursor.sh/` in a supported browser.
- **Switch Account** opens the same authenticator and waits for a different stable account ID when available, falling back to normalized email when IDs are unavailable.
- When the system's HTTPS handler is a supported browser, CodexBar opens the route there automatically. When the handler is an intermediary app, CodexBar asks the user to choose a concrete supported browser before opening the route.
- CodexBar pins the original HTTPS route to that concrete browser and polls cookies only from the same application. Interactive login never falls back to another browser, a stored session, or Cursor.app; cancelling browser selection or the absence of a supported browser stops before login opens.
- An installed non-Safari browser remains eligible before its first profile or cookie database exists, and CodexBar detects the store created during login. Browsers with access-blocked profile data remain unavailable, while Safari still requires an existing readable cookie source.
- CodexBar preserves its cached and legacy stored Cursor sessions while login is in progress. An accepted browser session must be durably cached before the legacy session is cleared, so cancellation or failure leaves the previous session intact. Add completes only after the authenticated response includes a Cursor account identity. Switch compares stable account IDs when both sides provide them and otherwise compares normalized email.
- CodexBar checks all available profiles in the selected browser. Add accepts a sole unambiguous account automatically, while Switch always asks for confirmation before replacing the current account, even when only one eligible alternative is found. Multiple eligible accounts always require an explicit choice, and CodexBar caches only the chosen session.
- A successful add or switch selects the Automatic cookie source. Saved manual headers and token accounts remain
  stored but passive: they do not override browser fetching, cached usage, quota warnings, or utilization/reset
  ownership. Explicitly selecting a saved token account switches Cursor back to Manual and reactivates it.

## API endpoints
- `GET https://cursor.com/api/usage-summary`
  - Plan usage (included), on-demand usage, billing cycle window.
- `GET https://cursor.com/api/auth/me`
  - Stable user ID, email, and name.
- `GET https://cursor.com/api/usage?user=ID`
  - Legacy request-based plan usage (request counts + limits).
- `POST https://cursor.com/api/dashboard/get-sand-usage-status`
  - Grok Bot weekly included usage (`usagePercent`, `nextResetTimestampUtc`). Same session cookie;
    requires `Origin: https://cursor.com`. Best-effort: a failure leaves Cursor's monthly bars intact.

## Cookie file paths
- Safari: `~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies`
- Chrome/Chromium forks: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/*/Cookies`
- Firefox: `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*/cookies.sqlite`

## Linux CLI
- Automatic usage (`codexbar usage --provider cursor`) supports the signed-in Cursor app on Linux after manual, cached, and
  stored sessions have been considered.
- Authentication order: manual cookie header → cached session → stored session → Cursor app access token.
- The app token is read from absolute `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`, then `$HOME/.config/...` when `HOME` is absolute, then the account home’s `.config/...`. Relative `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `HOME` values are ignored. The database is read-only; expired app tokens are not refreshed by CodexBar.
- Cursor usage includes the Grok Bot weekly allowance and reset time when the account exposes it. Grok Bot endpoint failures do not hide Cursor usage.
- Explicit `--source web` requires a manual cookie and never reads the app token.
- Automatic browser cookie import and the external-browser Add/Switch flow remain macOS app features.
- Manual cookie headers from `~/.config/codexbar/config.json` (or legacy `~/.codexbar/config.json`) work on Linux.

## Local storage footprint
When **Settings → Advanced → Track provider local storage** is enabled on macOS, CodexBar measures:
- `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor`
- `~/Library/Application Support/Caches/cursor-updater`
- `~/.cursor`
- `~/Library/Caches/Cursor`
- `~/Library/Caches/com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92`
- `~/Library/Caches/com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92.ShipIt`
- `~/Library/Caches/cursor-compile-cache`
- `~/Library/HTTPStorages/com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92`

The storage detail lists measured paths and their sizes. CodexBar does not delete Cursor data.

## Token cost (dashboard API)
The cost summary's Cursor section is opt-in: it only fetches when **Show cost summary** is enabled and the Cursor provider is on.
Unlike Claude and Codex cost (scanned from local session logs on this machine), Cursor cost is remote, account-wide data from the cursor.com dashboard, so it covers usage from every machine on the account.

Auth reuses the exact status-probe session resolution and cookie-source policy:
- **Auto**: Cursor.app local auth → cached cookie header → browser cookie import → stored session.
- **Manual**: a non-empty pasted cookie header is required and forwarded as-is, so cost and status share the same session; an empty header fails closed instead of falling back to another account.
- **Off**: the fetch is skipped in the app; `codexbar cost --provider cursor` fails explicitly and `/cost` returns a provider error row.

Fetch behavior:
- `POST https://cursor.com/api/dashboard/get-filtered-usage-events` (cookie-authenticated; requires a matching `Origin` for CSRF).
- Pages of 1000 events (up to 200 pages), with exact page-boundary overlap removed before aggregation. Reaching the safety cap or otherwise receiving fewer events than Cursor reports fails the refresh instead of publishing a partial total.
- Empty query windows return `{}`; empty terminal pages omit the event array but retain `totalUsageEventsCount`. Both shapes were verified against populated pages from the same live session. The decoder accepts only these exact omitted-array shapes, preserves the query count, and rejects malformed arrays or ambiguous envelopes; a terminal `{}` contradicting an earlier positive count still fails.
- The window start is snapped to the local day boundary so a 1-day window covers all of today and wider windows keep their full first day.

Two totals are reported from the same events:
- **API-rate estimate**: reported `tokenUsage.totalCents`, with an API-list-price fallback only when the field is missing or null. Fallbacks use the existing cached models.dev catalog or bundled rates at the event date, preserve Cursor's disjoint input/cache counters, and do not read native Codex custom pricing or refresh prices over the network. Reported zero remains zero; malformed, negative, nonfinite, or otherwise invalid costs stay unpriced and fail the same-model sum closed. Unknown models remain unpriced. Reported, estimated, and unpriced request counts remain visible even when a rejected cost invalidates a model total.
- **Cursor-metered** (`meteredCostUSD`): what Cursor's plan actually deducts over the window, shown as its own "Cursor-metered:" line.
- Metered-only request events remain visible even when Cursor does not include token details; cookie/config resolution failures stop the fetch instead of falling back to another session.

API-list-price estimates are not estimates of actual Cursor charges: they do not apply plan-specific Cursor Token Rates, regional adjustments, or legacy billing rules. `chargedCents` and Cursor-metered totals remain separate and unchanged. In Overview, history coverage describes the included sources' established history; a selected subscription without spend still makes amounts partial and remains disclosed in the subscription count, without erasing another source's known history days.

Caching: the app holds the snapshot for an in-memory hourly TTL, keyed by the history window plus the cookie source and resolved account (manual-cookie hash or auto-mode account fingerprint), so switching accounts or pasting a new cookie invalidates it immediately.

If Auto fetches usage with a cookie that the app still cannot confirm for the current account, the result stays unpublished. An unchanged account scope waits for the next normal or manual refresh instead of repeatedly forcing another request. Real account, history-window, provider, or cost-timezone changes still request a replacement; a successful fetch that confirms its own cookie can publish immediately.

## Snapshot mapping
- Primary: plan usage percent (included plan).
- Secondary: Cursor (Cursor models) usage percent.
- Tertiary: Third Party usage percent.
- Extra: Grok Bot usage from `get-sand-usage-status` when the account has a paid allowance or an unexpired trial. The current `includedLimitZero` field takes precedence over the older allowance flag. Exhausted active trials remain visible; missing, malformed, or expired trial dates do not grant an allowance. Grok Bot is not the semantic weekly window, so monthly Cursor Auto pace stays on the Cursor bar when this extra 7-day window is present. Paid 7-day Grok Bot extras still show weekly pace on that extra bar; trial extras without a recurring reset do not.
- Provider cost: Extra usage USD. A capped individual budget wins; team accounts without a user cap use the shared team on-demand budget.
- Reset: billing cycle end date for monthly bars; paid Grok Bot uses `nextResetTimestampUtc`, even if a trial-expiry field is also present. Trial-only allowances have no recurring reset or duration because trial expiration does not replenish quota.

### Enterprise and Business member budgets

For team plans with a fresh nonempty email from `/api/auth/me`, the usage probe also checks `/api/dashboard/teams` and
`/api/dashboard/get-team-spend`. It prefers `portal-selected-team-id` over `team_id`,
verifies the selection against the authenticated account's teams, and uses a sole
team when no selection cookie is present (including Cursor.app authentication).
Multiple teams without a selection remain on the usage-summary fallback.

The authenticated member's `overallSpendCents` and `effectivePerUserLimitDollars`
(or `monthlyLimitDollars` when the effective limit is absent) drive the primary
percentage and plan dollars. Missing spend or non-positive limits are not treated
as a zero-usage budget. Other members' data is not included in debug output.
The optional lookup shares a ten-second deadline and the configured request timeout, with at most twenty pages of
fifty members. It requires consistent page-count metadata, full intermediate pages, and the complete page set before accepting one
matching member. Missing completion metadata, duplicate matches, or unavailable, invalid, or incomplete responses
preserve usage-summary behavior. Billing dates and extra/on-demand charges remain sourced from usage-summary;
team response dates and other members' details are not retained. Caller cancellation still stops the fetch.
