# Codex Workspaces local index

Codex Workspaces attributes the existing local Codex cost scan to projects,
sessions, models, and days. This foundation is local-only library behavior; it
does not add a remote API, provider authentication flow, billing interface, or
public CLI JSON contract.

## Internal navigation scaffold

Debug builds can expose a Codex-only **Workspaces** menu action with
`CODEXBAR_ENABLE_WORKSPACES_MENU=1`. It opens one reusable native project and
session inspector. The inspector is cache-first: it shows the latest available
local snapshot immediately, keeps that content visible while an explicit
**Refresh usage data** action requests a new scan, and does not force a refresh
merely by opening the window. When detailed cached content is
absent, the inspector performs one normal sidecar-backed detail load. A
successful refresh that returns partial source data replaces the rendered snapshot
and remains labeled partial. A refresh that fails preserves the previously
rendered snapshot—complete or partial—and adds a recoverable failure notice. The existing hide-personal-information
projection is applied before paths, workspace names, working directories, or
session titles reach the inspector. Release builds always disable this gate,
even if the environment variable is present. Changing the selected source,
history range, or Hide Personal Info clears the old presentation and reloads the
visible window with the new configuration. An earlier request cannot publish
content from the old scope after that change.
Closing cancels this window's pending request. Reopening reuses a completed
snapshot, or starts a cache-first load after an interrupted initial load.

The basic inspector excludes Models analytics, charts, CSV/export,
search/filter controls, preference or opt-in changes, background indexing, and
index rebuild controls. Those remain separate follow-ups; this navigation layer
does not alter the foundation's scanner, sidecar, or persistence contracts.

## Data flow

`CostUsageScanner` remains authoritative for JSONL parsing, cumulative-token
deltas, fork and subagent accounting, pricing, and incremental cursors. The
Workspaces index combines that scan cache with the read-only Codex thread
catalog:

1. Scan local rollout JSONL into the SQLite cost cache.
2. Read catalog metadata without modifying the Codex catalog.
3. Canonicalize workspace attribution and scope it to the selected Codex home.
4. Publish the complete source state and derived snapshot in one SQLite
   transaction.
5. Expose project, session, model, daily, source-status, progress, and CSV
   library models to presentation consumers.

Project indexing reads exact usage rows and daily aggregates without loading
raw token snapshots. The read stays within one SQLite transaction, so a
concurrent scanner commit cannot turn a consistent project report into empty
history. This optimization applies to Workspaces indexing; the menu-bar scanner
already loads token snapshots lazily.

The supported internal presentation boundary is:

- `CostUsageFetcher.loadCachedCodexLocalProjectUsageSnapshot`
- `CostUsageFetcher.loadCodexLocalProjectUsageSnapshot`
- `CostUsageFetcher.clearCachedCodexLocalProjectUsageSnapshot`
- `CodexLocalProjectUsageSnapshot`
- `CodexLocalProjectUsageIndexProgress`

## Persistence contracts

The Codex cost cache is:

```text
~/Library/Caches/CodexBar/cost-usage/cost-usage.sqlite
```

The Workspaces sidecar is:

```text
~/Library/Caches/CodexBar/local-usage/codex-workspaces-v1.sqlite
```

The sidecar currently uses SQLite schema version 5 and snapshot payload format
3. This is the first released Workspaces schema. A database with any other
`PRAGMA user_version` is rejected as incompatible and is never modified.

### Legacy JSON cache cutover

The SQLite store rebuilds derived usage from session files instead of importing
the old monolithic `codex-v11.json` cache. When that legacy artifact is found,
the store removes it and its temporary copies and rebuilds the SQLite cache.
Source session files remain unchanged; subsequent scans reuse SQLite cursors.

### Sidecar rollback

Publication is transactional: a failed synchronization or snapshot write rolls
back and leaves the previous complete snapshot available.

Before importing source rows, the indexer validates the raw cost cache against
the selected Codex home. A failed read or retained cache from another home fails
the refresh before changing saved project history. A successfully scanned,
same-scope empty history remains valid and can replace earlier usage.

## Catalog completeness and last-good data

Catalog access distinguishes complete, missing, locked, corrupt, and
incompatible states. A complete read replaces catalog metadata for that Codex
home scope. A later same-scope incomplete read reports partial or stale source
status while retaining the last-good catalog attribution and usage snapshot.
Sparse rollout updates do not erase retained titles, workspace paths, or other
catalog metadata.

Scope identifiers and invalidation fingerprints are hashes; raw Codex-home
paths are not persisted as scope identifiers. Changed and deleted rollout files,
parser or pricing changes, history-window changes, and catalog changes
invalidate only the affected cached state.

## Cost and display semantics

Known model cost and unknown-cost coverage are represented separately. Unknown
pricing never becomes a synthetic zero-cost claim. Models analytics, parity
checks, performance telemetry, and CSV serialization operate on the same
persisted snapshot.

Display-only projections are transient:

- Hiding estimated cost does not rewrite the sidecar.
- Including or excluding cached input does not rescan or rewrite the sidecar.
- Hiding personal information removes persisted workspace paths, working
  directories, workspace names, and session titles from snapshots before they
  reach presentation code; it does not rewrite the local sidecar.
- Rankings, totals, charts, and breakdowns must use the same projection.

## Privacy boundary

The scanner, catalog reader, cache, sidecar, analytics, and CSV serializer run
locally. They do not upload rollout contents or catalog records. The stored
index can contain local workspace paths, session metadata, token totals, and
derived cost estimates, so runtime evidence must be sanitized before
publication. Remove paths, titles, session IDs, identities, tokens, keys,
network addresses, and database row contents from shared logs and screenshots.
