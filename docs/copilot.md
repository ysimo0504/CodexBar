# Copilot provider

Copilot uses GitHub OAuth device flow and the Copilot internal usage API for primary usage. Optional budget extras use GitHub web cookies only when enabled.

## Data sources + fallback order

1) **GitHub OAuth device flow** (user initiated)
   - Device code request:
     - `POST https://github.com/login/device/code`
   - Token polling:
     - `POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`
   - Optional enterprise host:
     - set Copilot `enterpriseHost` in `~/.codexbar/config.json` or the provider settings UI
     - CodexBar normalizes values such as `https://octocorp.ghe.com/login` to `octocorp.ghe.com`
     - device flow uses `https://<enterpriseHost>/login/...`
     - identity lookup uses `https://api.<enterpriseHost>/user`, matching the usage API host
     - default HTTPS ports and trailing host dots normalize to the same issuer; nondefault ports remain distinct
   - Scope: `read:user`.
   - Token stored in config:
     - `~/.codexbar/config.json` → `providers[].apiKey` for `copilot`
     - token accounts use `providers[].tokenAccounts`
     - Legacy token matching honors a resolved stable GitHub user ID; display-label fallback is used only when token identity is unavailable and no verified match exists.
     - Enterprise accounts match by API host and numeric user ID. They never adopt a public or unidentified legacy account merely because its login or label matches. The configured host still controls requests; stored account identifiers do not select an endpoint.
     - Enterprise sign-in requires a resolved identity. A cancelled sign-in or a host change while it is pending leaves saved accounts unchanged.

2) **Usage fetch**
   - `GET https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/user`
   - With an enterprise host, the API host is `api.<enterpriseHost>`.
   - Headers:
     - `Authorization: token <github_oauth_token>`
     - `Accept: application/json`
     - `Editor-Version: vscode/1.96.2`
     - `Editor-Plugin-Version: copilot-chat/0.26.7`
     - `User-Agent: GitHubCopilotChat/0.26.7`
     - `X-Github-Api-Version: 2025-04-01`

3) **Budget fetch** (optional GitHub web endpoint, best-effort)
   - Available only for the public GitHub host. Enterprise quota fetches skip public identity and browser-cookie budget enrichment.
   - Disabled by default. The Copilot provider's "Budget extras" setting must be enabled before CodexBar imports
     github.com cookies or renders budget bars.
   - CodexBar asks the logged-in GitHub web endpoint for customer-scope budgets:
     - `GET https://github.com/settings/billing/budgets?page=<page>&page_size=10&scope=customer`
   - Headers:
     - `Cookie: <github.com browser cookies>`
     - `Accept: application/json`
     - `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`
     - `GitHub-Verified-Fetch: true`
     - `X-Fetch-Nonce: <fresh nonce when available>`
   - CodexBar first tries to read a fresh nonce from `https://github.com/settings/billing/budgets`, then calls the JSON
     endpoint. If GitHub rejects the web request, CodexBar keeps the normal Copilot quota bars and omits budget bars.
   - This is intentionally not the public GitHub REST billing API. The REST API did not expose the personal budget list
     for the tested individual account.

## Snapshot mapping
- Primary: `quotaSnapshots.premiumInteractions` percent remaining → used percent.
- Secondary: `quotaSnapshots.chat` percent remaining → used percent.
- Extra: positive Copilot billing budgets from the GitHub web endpoint → `extraRateWindows`, only when "Budget extras"
  is enabled.
  - Product budget: `copilot`
  - SKU budgets: `copilot_premium_request`, `copilot_agent_premium_request`, `spark_premium_request`
- Seat AI credits: `quota_snapshots.premium_interactions.credits_used` → the shared "Credits used" provider-detail
  row, shown only when it carries real signal (token-based billing, unlimited quota, nonzero credits, or a
  configured seat entitlement) so a metered Pro/Individual seat never grows a permanent "0 credits used" row.
  Deliberately not summed with `chat`/`completions` credits — GitHub can report the same pool under multiple
  snapshot keys, and summing would double-count.
- Reset dates are not provided by the API.
- Plan label from `copilotPlan`.

## AI credit entitlements
GitHub does not publish an included-credit entitlement on any documented endpoint — all 8 billing endpoints plus
`budgets`, `cost-centers`, and `usage/summary` were probed, and none returns a ceiling for the seat. The denominator
is therefore user-entered:
- Preferences → Providers → Copilot → "Included AI credits (per seat)"

A configured entitlement turns the row into a progress bar ("31 / 3000") via the shared provider-detail row's
optional progress ratio. Without one, the row stays plain text, because a bar would imply a limit CodexBar cannot
actually know. Either way the row also carries the numeric credits used (`usageValue`), so editing or clearing
the entitlement rewrites the cached row (text ↔ bar) immediately, even when the follow-up refresh never lands
(offline, token lost, 401).

In Automatic mode, the provider tab uses this configured seat-credit ratio when no metered quota window is
available. It follows the used/remaining preference. Existing quota windows retain priority, explicit metric
selections retain their meaning, and a missing allowance leaves the tab's progress bar absent.

## Manual seat credit allowance

For token-billed seats, **Seat AI credit allowance** optionally turns the menu card's Credits used text into a progress
bar. Enter a positive monthly credit allowance; no ceiling is inferred from the plan. This is a local display preference,
separate from Budget extras, and does not set a GitHub billing limit. Icon, widget, and CLI quota windows are unchanged.

Each saved account can override the legacy global allowance. Clearing an override restores that fallback, or returns to
text if no fallback exists. **Clear default allowance** removes the legacy fallback while retaining explicit account
overrides; accounts inheriting that default return to text immediately, including while offline. Edits update the matching cached account without
changing its usage timestamp. Switching accounts preserves each account's usage; changing a credential or enterprise
host still invalidates its cached data. A refresh already in flight uses the current allowance when it publishes, so a
late successful response cannot restore a cleared default.
