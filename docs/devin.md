# Devin Provider

The Devin provider tracks included daily and weekly usage quotas from
[app.devin.ai](https://app.devin.ai).

## Setup

1. Sign in to Devin in Google Chrome.
2. Open the organization Usage & Limits page once.
3. Enable **Devin** in **Settings → Providers**.

Automatic mode reads only the Devin session and organization metadata from Chrome localStorage. It does not scan other
browsers or import other sites' sessions. Current decoded session values take precedence over raw storage fallback
data. CodexBar sends the session token only to `https://app.devin.ai`.

For accounts with multiple organizations, set **Organization** to select one explicitly. An internal `org-...` or
`org_...` ID takes precedence over Chrome's cached organization metadata. A slug uses only its matching cached ID;
open that organization's Usage & Limits page in Chrome if the metadata is missing.

## Manual Auth

Set **Auth source** to **Manual**, then paste either the bare token or the full `Authorization: Bearer ...` header value
from an app.devin.ai API request. The organization field accepts a slug, an internal `org-...` or `org_...` ID, or the
full organization URL. Manual mode does not import a browser session.

Some Auth1 sessions need the internal organization ID even when the same token works in the browser. If Devin returns
`No organizations found for auth1 user`, CodexBar reports organization guidance rather than treating the token as expired:

1. Open the organization's **Usage & Limits** page in the browser where you are signed in.
2. In Developer Tools → Network, inspect a successful `/billing/quota/usage` request.
3. Copy its `x-cog-org-id` request-header value into CodexBar's **Organization** field, then refresh.

The internal-ID path is already supported; manual mode does not discover IDs from public slugs. Other 401/403 responses
still report invalid or expired credentials. For automatic auth with missing organization metadata, open the
organization's Usage page in Chrome and refresh.

Environment overrides:

- `DEVIN_BEARER_TOKEN` or `DEVIN_AUTHORIZATION`
- `DEVIN_ORGANIZATION` or `DEVIN_ORG`

## Linux CLI

Automatic Chrome session import is macOS-only. On Linux, configure manual auth in
`~/.config/codexbar/config.json` (or your existing legacy config):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "providers": [{
    "id": "devin",
    "cookieSource": "manual",
    "cookieHeader": "Bearer YOUR_DEVIN_TOKEN",
    "workspaceID": "org_YOUR_ORGANIZATION"
  }]
}
```

Run `codexbar usage --provider devin`. You can omit `cookieHeader` when supplying
`DEVIN_BEARER_TOKEN` or `DEVIN_AUTHORIZATION`, but keep `cookieSource` set to `manual`.
The organization environment overrides also apply. Environment tokens take precedence
without enabling automatic auth; an empty override does not fall back to the configured token.

## Data Source

CodexBar requests:

```text
GET https://app.devin.ai/api/<internal-org-id>/billing/quota/usage
```

The response supplies daily and weekly usage percentages plus reset timestamps. CodexBar omits the daily quota when Devin sets `hide_daily_quota` to `true`, while retaining weekly usage and extra balance.
If Devin changes or expires the browser
session, sign in again and refresh CodexBar.
