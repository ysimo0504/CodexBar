# Hugging Face

CodexBar shows month-to-date Inference Providers charges and optional ZeroGPU quota. Billing details include
billable usage, reported gross/included amounts, and a configured spending limit when available. The billing
report does not establish a remaining-credit allowance or quota reset, so CodexBar does not invent either.
The prepaid/general compute-credit wallet is a separate billing concept and is not included here.
Identity (username and PRO/Free plan) comes from `whoami-v2`, cached for hours because Hugging Face rate-limits that
endpoint far more strictly than the rest of the Hub API.

The bundled `huggingface.ts` plugin owns every HTTP request and response projection. Native code reads the existing
CLI token and serializes access to the retained script runtime. Identity caching lasts up to 12 hours and is keyed by
the selected token, so switching accounts cannot reuse another account's identity.

## Authentication

Create an access token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), then add it in
CodexBar's provider settings or token accounts, or set:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

Token sources, in precedence order: CodexBar settings (`CODEXBAR_HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`), `HF_TOKEN`,
`HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN`, then the token saved by `hf auth login` (`$HF_TOKEN_PATH`, `$HF_HOME/token`,
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/huggingface/token`, or `~/.cache/huggingface/token`).

Classic `read` tokens can read billing. Fine-grained tokens must have the **Billing read** permission or the billing
endpoints return HTTP 403, which CodexBar surfaces with a pointer to this requirement.

## Data shown

- Inference charges calculated as `max(0, usedNanoUsd - includedNanoUsd)`, matching Hugging Face's billing UI.
- Reported gross/included inference amounts and the configured spending limit, when present.
- ZeroGPU GPU-time used/remaining and its reset, when the account has ZeroGPU quota.
- Username and plan (PRO/Free).

## Endpoint contract

The billing endpoint (`/api/settings/billing/usage-v2`) is listed in Hugging Face's OpenAPI spec, but its response
shape is not documented. CodexBar parses it defensively and reports a clear "response format changed" error if the
shape drifts instead of showing partial data. ZeroGPU quota and `whoami-v2` are fully documented endpoints and are
fetched best-effort — their failures preserve billing data.

Live verification confirmed `periodEnd` follows the requested `endDate`: it is the report cutoff, not a reset.
The public billing frontend deducts `includedNanoUsd` to calculate the charge; this does not establish monthly
credits remaining. PRO compute credits are shared with other products, so `isPro` does not imply an inference-only allowance.
