# Groq provider

CodexBar shows Groq organization usage and spend from the **console.groq.com** dashboard API, read through your
browser session. This replaces the old public-API rate-limit metric, which only described request/token throttles
rather than actual usage.

## Data sources + selection order

Default (`auto`) pipeline:

1. **Console (web, preferred).** Reads the console session cookie from the browser and calls the platform activity
   API for daily spend/token/request history.
2. **Prometheus metrics (Enterprise API key, fallback).** Only used when a session isn't available and an API key is
   configured; Enterprise-only, so standard keys return no data here.

Source modes: `web` (console only), `api` (Prometheus only), `auto` (console then Prometheus).

## Console (web)

- Session comes from the `groq.com` cookies, in browser import order:
  - `stytch_session` — long-lived (~30 day) opaque token. Preferred.
  - `stytch_session_jwt` — short-lived (~5 min) JWT. Used directly only as a fallback.
- Because the JWT cookie expires quickly and is refreshed by the SPA only while a console tab is open, CodexBar
  exchanges the long-lived opaque token for a fresh JWT on each fetch via Stytch's B2B frontend SDK endpoint (the same
  call the console web app makes):
  - `POST https://api.stytchb2b.groq.com/sdk/v1/b2b/sessions/authenticate`
  - Auth: `Authorization: Basic base64(<publicToken>:<sessionToken>)`, plus `X-SDK-Client`, `X-SDK-Parent-Host`, and
    `Origin: https://console.groq.com` headers.
  - The publishable Stytch token is built in; override with `GROQ_STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN` / `GROQ_STYTCH_URL` if Groq
    rotates it.
- Usage/spend:
  - `GET https://api.groq.com/platform/v1/organizations/{orgId}/activity?start_date={unix}&end_date={unix}`
  - `Authorization: Bearer <fresh session JWT>`.
  - The organization id is read from the JWT's `https://groq.com/organization` claim (no signature verification —
    the API authenticates the token, this only reads the routing claim).
- Each activity row is per-model, per-day: `cost`, `n_context_tokens_total`, `n_non_cached_context_tokens_total`
  (cached = context − non-cached), `n_generated_tokens_total`, `num_requests`. CodexBar aggregates these into daily
  buckets and renders the shared cost-history inline dashboard (as used by the OpenAI API provider).
- Identity login method: `Console`.

### Testing / CLI overrides

- `GROQ_SESSION_TOKEN` — an opaque `stytch_session` value; exercises the full refresh path.
- `GROQ_SESSION_JWT` — a session JWT used directly (skips refresh); handy for a quick check but expires in minutes.

```bash
GROQ_SESSION_TOKEN=<stytch_session> codexbar usage --provider groq --json
```

## Prometheus metrics (Enterprise, optional)

- Requires an Enterprise API key stored in `~/.codexbar/config.json` (Settings → Providers → Groq) or `GROQ_API_KEY`.
- `GET https://api.groq.com/v1/metrics/prometheus/api/v1/query` for `rate5m` request/token/cache series.
- Standard keys receive HTTP 404 here (Enterprise-only feature), so this path simply yields no data for them.

Prometheus mode treats malformed, negative, nonfinite, or overflowing rates as unavailable. An explicitly empty result vector still means zero usage; API errors retain the server message.
